# What is Data2Vec newly published by Meta AI? 

It can process multiple types of data (audio, text, image) within one structure??!!!! Really???!!! How does it work? and how is the performance? 

Previouly we have the concept "word2vec", word embedding technique, talking about converting word to vector presentation. For example: 

Text: "I like to play table tennis!" 
word2vec: a matrix to represent the text
