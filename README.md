Overview: Natural Language Processing ("NLP") is to process and analyze natural language data from text or audio formats. 

It is fanscinating how a model can understand text and spoken words in much the same way as human being can???!!! 

The use cases that I have worked on: 

1. Social Media Text Mining and analytics (Goal: understand and monitor the sentiment/topics/issues that people are talking about related to the product/company of interest). 
2. Review/Feedback Analysis (Goal: automate the process to summarize and monitor the sentiment/topics/issues from the customers' feedbacks to better improve the product and improve customer satifactory). 
3. Product Data Quality (Goal: Detect potential conflicts within the product description, product attributes, product images and product doucments provided at different time/different resources). 
4. customer-faced/associated-faced Chatbots (For Sure: NLP; NLU; NLG).
5.
